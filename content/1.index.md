  <template #content> 
      I am an immigrant twice over - I grew up an Indian in the middle east (Oman) & did my undergrad at the University of Michigan.
      During my time at university, my work experience has primarily been as a full-stack web developer, primarily having written and maintained large applications that use Python Flask and Ruby on Rails. In the past, I have worked at the <a href="https://ai.umich.edu/">Center for Academic Innovation at the University of Michigan</a> and I have also interned at Apple.
      I am an ardent believer in technology and its potential for building a better future for humanity. I think technology's ability to do this hinges on a few key issues such as privacy, the absence of censorship and the continued expansion of the open-source philosophy - both within software development as well as in all other spheres of human creativity.
